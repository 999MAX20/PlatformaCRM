# PRIMARY-SESSION — PlatformaCRM

## INTEGRATIONS-REVIEW-20261008 — functional audit and redesign reference

Owner request: full functional analysis of /integrations, redesign proposal based
on the existing application design system, and a generated reference. Mode audit/
design proposal, not implementation or activation of external integrations.
Same registered primary/canonical root/branch; clean base
`4ed44964f373a43ce195898c02d5f912edccf6ac`. Inspect the canonical /app/integrations
route, reachable five-provider catalog, setup/import flows, API/services/permissions,
states and tests. Distinguish static implementation, isolated reproduced behavior,
historical evidence and live provider readiness. Use neutral/emerald tokens,
Manrope typography and current flat sidebar. Reference uses explicitly labelled
example states; no invented production metrics or implied provider availability.
Checks: targeted isolated browser walkthrough/screenshots and representative
error/permission states with mocked external boundaries; source evidence and
proposal/reference visual+interaction QA; docs/diff hygiene. No code fixes,
new providers, live sends/sync, working-DB writes/migrations, app dependency installs
or broad certification/build for a proposal. Record findings and a bounded
implementation recommendation; do not start implementation automatically.

Result: [full report](../integrations-functional-review-20261008.md) records the
five-provider inventory, reproducible generic-config 400/hidden modal error,
needs_attention filter omission, partial-failure misleading metrics, ignored
deep-link and static business-scope/request-state/monitoring risks. No product
fixes or new provider scope. First isolated audit: 2 PASS; operator locator
failed (wrong test-id, correct product denial). Corrected audit locator then
owner/operator desktop/mobile 4 PASS. Commands/logs/boundaries in report.
Interactive reference uses existing semantic colors, type, flat rail, service
rows and contextual setup/import panel. Reference QA desktop/390/320px,
validation, mock import, search/reset and Escape PASS after replacing QA
textbox locator with native searchbox. No application rebuild/backend full
suite: application inputs unchanged; scoped audit only. No working DB or
external sends. Docs validator PASS: 56 active documents, 370 local links,
14 anchors, 38 plain paths, 198 archived bodies intact; working diff hygiene
PASS. Publication SHA/actual CI are recorded in final response/local receipt.

## SIDEBAR-FLAT-NAV-20261008 — owner-requested navigation simplification

Mode targeted UI implementation. Owner requests removing Channels/Control
group containers and showing their contents as independent sidebar entries.
Reuse existing Integration, Analytics and Timeline links, icons, active states,
permission filters and mobile drawer. Same primary/root/branch; clean base
`73582953ec50f20112b4caf5dbbe62095edf4948`. Scope Sidebar navigation configuration
and evidence; no routes, permissions, backend, notifications, BusinessEvent, AI,
migrations or environment changes. Risk navigation visibility/reachability.
Checks: affected desktop collapsed/expanded + mobile drawer, keyboard navigation,
representative allowed/restricted roles; one isolated frontend build/types/i18n/
bundle and diff/docs consistency. No full E2E/backend suite. Normal commit/push
and remote SHA/actual CI readback after scoped PASS.

Implementation: only the two sidebar configuration arrays were flattened. The
three original links/icons/permission resources and their order are preserved;
top-level active states, keyboard navigation and mobile close-on-navigation are
reused. Visible RU names remain «Подключения», «Аналитика», «История».
Checks: `node --test scripts/tests/sidebar-navigation-policy.test.mjs` in
frontend — 7 PASS. `.venv/Scripts/python.exe output/sidebar-flat-nav-20261008/verify_frontend.py`
— isolated build/types/i18n/widget/bundle PASS.
`.venv/Scripts/python.exe output/ui-operations-20261008/verify_ui.py desktop-chromium ui-operations.spec.ts --grep "sidebar standalone" --project=mobile-chromium`
— 4 PASS (owner/operator desktop/mobile), log `browser-1791443167223872900.log`.
Owner's three direct keyboard routes and mobile drawer closing verified;
operator cannot see the restricted links. Desktop collapsed/expanded and mobile
screenshots inspected. Original expanded screenshot caught a width transition;
capture now disables animations. Focused desktop owner recheck (`--grep
"sidebar standalone navigation respects owner"` without mobile project) 1 PASS,
`browser-1791443292272058700.log`; completed expansion visually checked.
Docs validator — 55 documents/363 links/14 anchors/38 paths, 198 archived
sources intact PASS. No backend/full E2E: navigation configuration only.
No dependency install, working-DB changes or external provider calls.
Task complete locally; reviewed working/index/committed diff, normal push and
remote SHA readback recorded with actual CI in final response/local receipt.

## INBOX-EMPTY-FILTERS-20261008 — targeted owner refinements

Follow-up during publication: owner requests channel-neutral empty-state copy:
«Новые обращения с подключённых каналов появятся здесь автоматически»; keep the
title. Base `aa323fae7231313efd3a05bda149467b02936553` already normal-pushed and
remote read back. Scope only RU/KK/EN emptyText translations and this evidence;
reuse passed interaction/permission checks. Risk copy/layout only. Check affected
desktop/mobile empty view, i18n/build and diff hygiene; no backend/full E2E.
Follow-up result: RU/KK/EN copy changed, title unchanged. Same isolated build
command rerun after translations: PASS. Browser command above with grep
`"Inbox channel shortcut and"` and both `--project=desktop-chromium` /
`--project=mobile-chromium`: 2 PASS; log `browser-1791440356262436900.log` in
UI-OPERATIONS output. New desktop/mobile empty screenshots inspected; text fits.
Original UI commit CI `37736805660` was in progress at readback. Follow-up
commit/normal push/remote SHA and current CI recorded in final response/receipt.

Owner requests after rollback: remove the list empty-state card border, align
three empty panels, move connect-channel CTA into the empty thread and open the
customer agent Channels section, widen the two quick-filter menus and hide their
scrollbar while retaining scrolling/keyboard access. Mode implementation; UI/code
gap. Same primary, canonical root and branch; clean base `3c2182ea7bd569c1f6afc7b53d50e9384b0fb1ed`.
Reuse Inbox panes, existing channel route, i18n, Select and no-scrollbar utility.
No redesign of populated Inbox, backend/AI/permissions/notifications/BusinessEvent,
migrations, environment changes or external calls. Risk: menu clipping, keyboard
access, mobile CTA reachability and wrong agent/permission routing.
Checks: affected empty/filtered/populated Inbox, direct channel navigation,
restricted-role absence, desktop/mobile + RU/KK/EN visual and keyboard inspection;
representative default Select consumer, one isolated build/types/i18n/bundle,
docs/link consistency and working/index/committed diff hygiene. No broad E2E or
backend suite for unchanged services. Explicit reviewed commit/normal-push and
remote SHA/actual CI readback complete this bounded task.

Result: implementation/local acceptance PASS. List empty headline, thread CTA
and CRM empty message share the pane centre; list card framing removed. Three
columns fit 1280px without clipping the inspector. Existing filled panels remain.
Channels shortcut targets the first customer (non-CRM) agent of the active
business; no-agent fallback is the existing agent workspace. Only authorized
roles see it; mobile empty list retains the reachable action. Expanded Select is
opt-in for two quick filters, with full option labels, hidden scrollbar and
keyboard active-option scrolling; default advanced-filter Select also checked.

Checks (isolated disposable fixtures, no paid/external calls):
- `.venv/Scripts/python.exe output/ui-operations-20261008/verify_ui.py desktop-chromium ui-operations.spec.ts --grep "Inbox channel"`
  — 1 PASS, `browser-1791439955650005400.log`.
- Same command with `mobile-chromium` — 2 PASS (flow + restricted operator),
  `browser-1791440036828560700.log`. Direct Channels navigation by keyboard,
  queue/owner selection, Escape/focus, default advanced Select, empty/filtered/
  populated Inbox and unsent draft verified. RU/KK/EN desktop/mobile screenshots
  inspected in the corresponding `output/ui-operations-20261008/browser-*` folders.
- `.venv/Scripts/python.exe output/inbox-empty-filters-20261008/verify_frontend.py`
  — build/types/i18n/app/widget/bundle PASS; `frontend-isolated-final.log` alongside.
- `.venv/Scripts/python.exe output/docs-reset-20261007/verify.py` — 55 active
  documents, 362 links, 14 anchors, 38 paths PASS; 198 archive sources intact.
No failed checks. Backend/full E2E skipped: no backend or cross-cutting behavior
change. No dependencies installed, working DB migrations or deployment performed.
Working/index/actual committed range reviewed before normal publication; final
SHA, remote readback and actual CI status are in the task response/local receipt.

## INBOX-UI-ROLLBACK-20261008 — owner-requested rollback

Owner request: restore the Inbox UI preceding `8bb54dd`; the previous version
was preferred. Approved requirement change reopens only the Inbox UI portion of
UI-OPERATIONS, not the other five screens. Base `8bb54ddc5c08d562ca985bbccbdfccd3de7de3bf`,
clean canonical checkout, same primary/branch. Restore the three conversation UI
files and their Inbox-only copy to `79ffca5`; keep AI/backend/domain behavior.
Risk: accidentally reverting other screens or safety/recovery. Checks: exact
source comparison, targeted empty/populated Inbox and existing manual AI-recovery
browser flows desktop/mobile in isolation, one frontend build/types/i18n/bundle,
documentation consistency and working/index/committed diff. No backend changes,
new paid calls, working-DB changes, dependency installs or broad E2E. Commit and
normal-push after checks under standing authorization.

Result: exact source comparison against `79ffca5` PASS for all three UI files
and every Inbox translation in RU/KK/EN. Restored original panels/filter row/copy;
AI settings, provider behavior and other five screens are untouched.
Isolated build/i18n/types/app/widget/bundle PASS via
`.venv/Scripts/python.exe output/inbox-ui-rollback-20261008/verify_frontend.py`;
log `output/inbox-ui-rollback-20261008/frontend-isolated-final.log`.
Browser command prefix `.venv/Scripts/python.exe output/ui-operations-20261008/verify_ui.py`:
desktop/mobile `ui-operations.spec.ts e2e/inbox-agent-safety.spec.ts --grep "Inbox restored|Inbox pause"`.
Mobile 2 PASS (`browser-1791439073961115800.log`); desktop AI recovery PASS
(`browser-1791439032766988200.log`), restored-layout test initially expected an
unused subtitle. Corrected to the actual existing heading, then desktop
`ui-operations.spec.ts --grep "Inbox restored"` 1 PASS
(`browser-1791439204900938200.log`). Logs/screenshots in the UI-OPERATIONS output
directory; original failure retained. Empty/filtered/filled views, draft and
manual controls after AI limit verified. No product changes to satisfy the test.
Docs validator: 55 documents, 361 links, 14 anchors, 38 plain paths PASS;
archive preserved. No backend suites/full E2E or paid calls: runtime backend and
AI code unchanged. Reviewed 11 task-owned paths; working/index/actual committed
range checked for publication. Final SHA and actual CI reported in task response.

## UI-OPERATIONS-20261008 — implementation and local acceptance complete

Source: owner-approved UI/UX audit relayed by task
`01a0f32f-7d02-7263-a53d-496c8f9787f5` with explicit instruction to implement the
whole package in this registered primary. This is new scope, not ownership
transfer. Same generation 4 primary, root `C:/Users/user/Desktop/PlatformaCRM`,
branch `codex/ui-testing-toolkit`, clean starting HEAD
`79ffca5c2b4437750bb7559ce34453ab6c247a29`; no pre-existing changes.
Mode targeted defect correction and approved UI implementation; gaps code/data/UX.

Observable result and complete authorized scope:
- Leads: one create CTA, correctly named import in additional actions, consistent
  terminology, one nearby filter entry, no empty pagination/selection; distinguish
  no data/filter-empty/error. Compact creation form without losing fields.
- Deals: risk is attention, not hot sales; next task/action/date and no-step filter
  agree; honest empty columns and readable entity hierarchy, existing kanban retained.
- Calendar: day/week/month arrows and period heading match view, month/year boundaries
  and selected-mode accessibility; compact controls, slot creation preserved.
- Inbox: coherent empty state; readable filters with separate owner/AI-agent labels,
  filter icon/count; populated conversations, CRM context, drafts and AI pilot preserved.
- Settings: group business profile/contacts, appointments, finance and appearance;
  keep fields/permissions/drafts/save behavior; remove redundant framing/headings;
  group expansion matches visible children and accessibility state.
- Dashboard: real scoped today appointments/confirmations, waiting conversations
  and overdue tasks; full distinct counts separate from previews. Ordered/deduplicated
  entity action queue plus upcoming appointments; owner finance uses actual net
  receipts/source/period/freshness, useful grounded AI summary stays compact.
  Correct deep links, unavailable/error states never mean zero or all clear.

Approved layout reference (conditional data only):
`C:/Users/user/.codex/visualizations/2026/09/30/01a0f32f-7d02-7263-a53d-496c8f9787f5/crm-dashboard-proposal.html`.
Use composition, existing neutral/emerald tokens and RU/KK/EN. No demo data or
role-switch UI. Reuse workQueues/analytics selectors, current API clients, controls,
forms, scopes and existing tests. Minimal read-contract extensions if needed;
no new lifecycle/booking/money policy, notification, audit/BusinessEvent types,
CRM AI development, paid AI calls, external messages/integrations or deployment.
No schema/environment change expected; no working-DB seed/migration, dependency
reinstall, alternate source tree or stopping other processes.

Verification plan: before dependent UI, isolated backend regression for each
coherent count/queue change: overlaps, totals beyond preview limit, stable order,
role/tenant/capability scope and invalid input. Calendar unit/interaction checks
include different views and month/year boundaries. Targeted reachable browser
flows desktop/mobile, keyboard, RU/KK/EN, empty/filter-empty/error/recovery and
populated Inbox. Preserve customer AI safety/recovery/permissions through affected
regressions. Final frontend build/types/i18n/bundle, affected/dependent backend
tests + system/migration drift; no blanket full E2E absent demonstrated need.
Record exact commands/snapshots/results and preserved failures. Finish all six
areas, reviewed docs/checkpoint/STATUS, conventional commit and normal HEAD:main
push with remote SHA and actual CI. No intermediate approval gates or new phases.

Implementation checkpoint: all six areas are implemented in the same dirty
snapshot above. Work queues now expose full distinct operational counts, business
day/timezone, availability/scope and ordered entity previews; disabled/denied
modules cannot reappear through unassigned rows. Backend regression was red
before the fix; the focused gate passed before dependent UI. Query-budget failure
(63 versus 58) was corrected by reusing already loaded category previews.
Final affected/dependent backend gate: 78 tests PASS, system check PASS, no migration
drift; `output/ui-operations-20261008/backend-1791411501420078900.log`.
Calendar/dashboard/policy unit checks: 9 PASS. Six desktop flows passed across
targeted runs; all six mobile flows PASS in `browser-1791411479584303500.log`.
Screenshots inspected for compact form, calendar, settings, Inbox and dashboard.
Earlier selector mismatches and build errors are retained in the same output
directory; they were corrected rather than waived. Additional role/recovery and
navigation-accessibility checks passed: 7 desktop, 4 mobile and 2 tablet scenarios.
Isolated build/types/i18n/widget/bundle PASS; the post-success helper stdout
encoding issue is documented, not a product failure.
[Final evidence and exact checks](../ui-operations-20261008.md) preserve earlier
failures and exclusions. Updated frontend/CRM contracts and capability map.
Documentation registry/link/archive checks PASS: 55 active documents, 359 local
links, 14 anchors, 38 plain paths; preserved archive unchanged. Working diff
hygiene PASS; entire intended source/tests/docs and new files reviewed. Final
publication SHA, committed-range/index checks and actual CI are recorded in the
task response and `output/ui-operations-20261008/publication.json`; no new phase.

## PREPROD-AI-EVIDENCE-20261008 — documentation update

Owner request: update pre-prod with completed customer-agent behavior checks.
Docs-only evidence gap; same generation 4 primary/root/branch, clean base
`de1867bd7ed3a2350fdfdb7dfc35c8ca8c365e69`. Reuse the two acceptance reports,
final case/semantic review and verified publication receipt. No product behavior,
permissions, notifications, BusinessEvent, schema, environment or paid AI changes.
Risk: overstating coverage, conflating real model with real delivery, summing
overlapping tests or leaving stale version/CI status. Update existing passport
and pre-prod navigation/status; preserve historical evidence and external gaps.
Checks: counts/source/CI consistency, local links/anchors, registry and reviewed
working/index/committed diff hygiene. No app tests/build/install/model calls for
Markdown. Completion: reviewed docs commit, normal push and actual CI status.

Result: current passport contains the six-group behavioral matrix, observed
outcomes, fixes, handoff/recovery semantics, supporting checks, costs and limits.
Version and successful application CI are current; pre-prod navigation updated.
Five registered Markdown files, 65 local links/anchors and final 43-case/CI receipt
consistency PASS; diff hygiene PASS. Initial verification helper expected six
files instead of the actual five; corrected to an explicit scope list, then PASS.
No application checks or paid calls rerun. Documentation publication and its
push-triggered CI status are reported in the final response; prior application
CI SUCCESS is evidence for de1867b, not for a future documentation commit.

## INBOX-LOCAL-PILOT-20261008 — complete

Publication readback: `de1867bd7ed3a2350fdfdb7dfc35c8ca8c365e69` normal-pushed
to main; [CI37684198877](https://github.com/999MAX20/PlatformaCRM/actions/runs/37684198877)
backend/frontend SUCCESS. Local receipt `output/inbox-local-pilot-20261008/publication.json`.
The pre-publication steps below were completed; no product work remains in this scope.

Owner authorized completing the existing customer-agent pilot locally: safe
customer scenarios, handoff communication and fast flexible staff configuration.
No new capabilities, CRM-agent development, messenger integrations, production
hosting/database/workers or real customer delivery. Explicit separate USD1 budget.
Same generation 4 registered primary, root `C:/Users/user/Desktop/PlatformaCRM`,
branch `codex/ui-testing-toolkit`, clean base `0112475850c631cd946424c86f49e363c6b80881`.
All changed/untracked source/docs belong to this task; no original WIP or owner drift.
Prior base CI37676924581 SUCCESS. No ownership or runtime-env changes.

Mode audit/targeted implementation/verification; gaps code, UX and local evidence.
Reused safety/pipeline/outbox/recovery, profiles/settings/readiness, API clients,
design system/i18n and existing targeted suites. Risks: duplicate/stale sends,
private-data leakage, automatic writes without permission, lost settings/drafts.
Plan executed: focused isolated backend regressions after coherent fixes, affected/
dependent suites + system/drift, targeted isolated UI/API desktop/mobile/locales/
keyboard, final build/bundle. No full-project local gate, working DB or new install.

Implemented deterministic handoff acknowledgement with outbox idempotency and
revocation guards; empty-reply and mid-turn call-limit handoff fixes. One booking
control saves both permissions/settings; safe mode guards; advanced disclosures;
actual dental template respects saved permissions. No schema, new role or new
BusinessEvent; existing activity/audit/notifications retained. Details and exact
commands/skips/errors: [report](../inbox-local-pilot-20261008.md).

Verification: 241 scoped backend PASS before final call-limit fix; 72 affected
tests PASS after fix, system/drift PASS. 16 selected browser scenarios PASS and
one localized mobile recheck after i18n ordering fix. Build/types/i18n/widget and
bundle PASS; representative screenshots reviewed. Live final 43/43 PASS plus
semantic output/record review; run customer_pilot-1791405340114934200. Cumulative
145 reservations, 143 received calls, USD0.1416664 including failure reserves
of USD1. Final Python/i18n manifest matches. No more paid calls needed.

Evidence `output/inbox-local-pilot-20261008/`: append-only live cases/transport/
manifests + cumulative ledger, semantic-review.json, backend/browser/build logs.
All failed attempts retained: initial missing notice/takeover RED, first live
38/39 with call-limit defect, fixture-quota browser failures, bad selectors/grep,
two nonexistent backend labels and i18n build error. Corrected runs cited in report.

Completed DoD: final source/docs/index/secret review and diff hygiene,
conventional commit, fetch/prove fast-forward normal push HEAD:main, remote SHA
readback and actual CI. Do not call CI green before readback. Publication receipt
goes in local publication.json and final response; candidate is report's commit.
Next product boundary is real channel/target environment/staff acceptance, excluded
here and not automatically authorized. No own server/job is intentionally retained.

## INBOX-LIVE-ACCEPTANCE-20261008 — behavioral PASS; publication below

Owner authorized real-model acceptance of ordinary inquiries, booking, protection
and recovery, including fixes for reproduced in-scope defects. Explicit new budget:
USD 1 maximum, stop before exceeding it; prior task budgets are not reused.
Mode verification/targeted fixes; gap evidence. Same generation 4 primary/root/
branch; clean base `00fe0e7c8743a4b84d136db9492e9228e88beecd`.

Reuse `scripts/ai_behavior`, isolated_runtime, current Inbox pipeline, domain
services and existing safety/booking/recovery tests. Synthetic disposable DB,
real configured AI provider only; controlled outbound receipts, never real
customers or messenger delivery. No working DB, migration, deployment, billing,
CRM-agent/analytics development or new integration rollout.

Changed behavior initially none; if a defect reproduces, minimal correction and
focused regression before dependent work. Risks: budget overflow, false booking,
privacy leak, false handoff, duplicate work and stale replies after recovery.
Acceptance checks facts vs fixture, actual records/relationships and timestamps,
no writes without valid consent, denial/tenant boundaries, sensitive context,
limits and replay, provider failure/manual takeover/resume. Review model output
semantically; HTTP success alone is not PASS. Test controls cannot masquerade as
live channel, infrastructure or clinic acceptance.

Focused checks: existing customer safety/state/recovery, automatic booking,
runtime configuration, Inbox continuity and AI job recovery in isolated runtime;
test budget harness before live use. Add explicit USD1 CLI budget and a targeted
Inbox suite if needed, retaining cumulative attempts/reservations across retries.
Completion: affected/dependent backend suites plus system/migration checks if
runtime changes; reachable API flow, relevant UI/build only if changed. No full
project/E2E gate by default. Docs links/registry/diff checks; reviewed commit,
normal HEAD:main push, remote SHA and actual CI. Keep all failed attempts visible.

Initial plan: prepare selected synthetic scenarios and run deterministic baseline, then
bounded live evaluation. Evidence under `output/inbox-live-acceptance-20261008/`.

First results: 53 focused tests/system/migration drift PASS; 6 budget-harness tests
PASS; 4 no-provider safety/API dry cases PASS. First live 27 cases: 25 machine
PASS, 2 harness failures (ambiguous request expectation contradicted permitted
uncertain handoff; held-worker simulation accidentally used eager result backend).
Retain both failures and fix test setup/criteria transparently, not runtime policy.
Semantic review found a real wrong off_topic classification for clinic address,
and busy/denied booking selection led to another model confirmation of an
unavailable/uncommittable time. Appointment writes remained protected.

Bounded fix plan: clarify business-information categories in qualification;
when existing booking service returns requires_staff, call existing handoff
service and, when auto replies enabled, send existing localized handoff copy.
No new booking permission/policy/endpoint/schema/UI. Existing handoff activity,
audit and manager notification apply; pipeline event retains actual decision.
Add failing pipeline regression for busy, staff-only and disabled-tool selection,
verify immediately; strengthen live assertions and retest affected scenarios.
Provider-failure injection reserves cost conservatively; cumulative ledger stays
under the separately approved USD1. No real messenger delivery claimed.

Final behavioral gate: 130 affected/dependent backend PASS, system/migration-drift
PASS (`backend-1791401726512442200.log`); final live run 28/28 machine and semantic
PASS, 57 real calls. Total 55 case attempts retained, 110 received provider calls,
2 injected-failure reservations. Provider-reported USD0.1104668, conservative
charged/reserved USD0.1228916 of USD1. Final source manifest matches current Python
files. No further paid calls needed. Detailed commands, deltas and limitations:
[acceptance report](../inbox-live-acceptance-20261008.md). Next: final docs/source
review and diff gate, commit/push and actual CI. No new phase. Prior docs CI
37667508038 is now confirmed SUCCESS. Working DB/servers/dependencies unchanged.

## DOCS-RESET-20261007 — консолидация документации

Mode docs; gap — устаревшие маршруты/смешение требований и истории. Владелец
разрешил сверку реализации, обновление README и активных источников, архивацию
старых документов. Один writer generation 4 `01a11776-e13a-76c2-9fc0-75d38228f649`.
Canonical root `C:/Users/user/Desktop/PlatformaCRM`, branch `codex/ui-testing-toolkit`,
clean base `f01d22610118e3a24df86257943a8be91314f916`.

### Контракт и план проверок

Результат: компактный реестр current contracts + паспорта + процедуры; агенты
не берут старые технические планы как действующие. Reuse существующих решений,
паспортов, source/tests и evidence; не переписывать продукт. Риск — потеря правил,
открытых обязательств или ложный live PASS. Поэтому оригиналы сохраняются с SHA256,
последние решения сверяются, незакрытое переносится явно.

Нет изменений кода, схемы, runtime, dependencies, ownership, permissions,
notification, BusinessEvent или AI-поведения. Никаких provider calls, миграций,
deployment или новой продуктовой фазы. Формулировки контрактов сохраняют уже
утверждённые границы, не утверждают архивные предложения.

Checks: inventory/classification, source/decision traceability, archive byte
integrity, active links/anchors/plain paths, agent routing/frontmatter/scenarios,
registry invariants, working/index/actual committed-range diff hygiene. Проверка
новых/нетрекнутых файлов обязательна. App tests/build/install/DB/browser — skipped:
документационная задача, программные входы неизменны. CI запускается существующим
push workflow независимо; его результат проверяется отдельно и не выдумывается.

### Сделано

- 198 прежних проектных документов учтены; 137 перенесены из активного дерева,
  20 прежних entrypoint/procedure/passport тел сохранены перед обновлением,
  40 старых архивных тел и один generated inventory сохранены на месте.
- Созданы 9 current контрактов и source-backed карта возможностей. Сохранены
  актуальные паспорта и стабильные пути процедур/реестра владельца.
- Убраны старые competing планы/redirect stubs; обновлены AGENTS, README, маршруты
  skills; архив имеет отдельную инструкцию non-authority и исключение `.rgignore`.
- Открытые FC/BE/UX/FB и бизнес-решения не закрыты переносом. Последние controlled
  AI creation / manual financial source / support-note / deferred billing решения
  отделены от старых предложений. Предыдущая safety live boundary сохранена.

### Проверки и публикация

Состояние: содержательная проверка PASS. `verify.py` в локальном evidence: 198
исходных Git blobs/сохранённых тел, 52 active entries (30 проектных +22 skill),
328 local links, 12 active anchors, 38 plain paths — PASS. Проверены JSON registry
без изменений ownership, skill frontmatter и отсутствие архива в default rg.
Сценарии маршрутизации: новая CRM/AI/UI задача ведёт к current contract;
исторический PASS читается точечно без открытия scope; unresolved acceptance
остаётся открытым; compaction не меняет владельца. Runtime references к
DKB/generated inventory и ZR-001–010 сохранены. Рабочий/index diff hygiene PASS; 198 staged archive blobs совпали с исходными
SHA256, посторонних non-document paths и unstaged diff нет. Зависший пустой
index.lock снят после проверки возраста, отсутствия Git-процессов и exclusive-open;
индекс и HEAD не менялись другим writer. Реальный committed range и remote/CI
проверяются на этапе публикации.
Детальные безопасные результаты: `output/docs-reset-20261007/` (локальные artifacts).
Документальная часть завершена и проверена. Публикация: reviewed explicit paths,
conventional commit, normal HEAD:main push,
remote SHA readback и фактический CI. Итоговый SHA/CI — в ответе задачи и локальной
квитанции; commit не может содержать собственный hash. Следующий продуктовый этап
не назначен. Незакрытые требования — [acceptance](../../current/acceptance.md).

### Сохранённая история
